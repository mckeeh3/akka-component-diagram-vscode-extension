# Billing

Akka provides detailed billing information to help organizations monitor and manage the operational costs associated with their projects. Users with the **billing-admin** role can view:

- **Cost breakdown** for each project in the organization.
- **Month-to-date aggregate cost**.
- **Cost forecast** based on current and projected usage across all projects.
Billing data is accessible only to users with the **billing-admin** role. For more information on assigning this role, see the [Assigning the billing-admin Role](about:blank#assigning_billing_admin) section below.

## <a href="about:blank#_billing_interface"></a> Billing Interface

For **billing-admin** users, a billing icon appears in the [Akka Consoleâ€™s](https://console.akka.io/) side navigation. Clicking this icon opens the billing interface, where users can select the billing month and organization to view detailed billing data.

If a user is a billing admin for multiple organizations, they can switch between organizations in the billing UI.

In the billing UI:

- **Month-to-date costs** and a **cost forecast** for the current month are displayed in the upper-right corner.
- Billing data for each project within the selected organization is broken down into the following categories:

  - **Network Data Transfer**: Charges for data transfer across all services, measured in GB.
  - **Data Operations**: Total read and write operations for all services.
  - **Data Persistence**: Total amount of data persisted during the month, measured in GB-Hours.
These are all metered at the project, region, service scope and you can see the totals across organization, project, region, or service as you choose.

## <a href="about:blank#assigning_billing_admin"></a> Assigning the billing-admin Role

The organization superuser can assign the billing-admin role in one of two ways:

1. **Invite a User**: Use the following command to invite a user to the organization and assign the billing-admin role:

```command
akka organizations invitations create --organization <organization name> \
--email <email address> --role billing-admin
```
2. **Assign an Existing User**: If the user is already a member, the superuser can assign the billing-admin role directly:

```command
akka organization users add-binding --organization <organization name> \
  --email <email address> --role billing-admin
```
For more details on managing users and their roles, see the [Managing organization users](manage-users.html) section.
